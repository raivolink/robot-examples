# Template: Python - Actions

This template gets you started in creating Actions for [Robocorp Action Server](https://github.com/robocorp/robo/tree/master/action_server/docs#readme).

`Actions` and `Action Server` enable you to "give your AI Agents hands" meaning that your AI/LLM Agent can help your users perform distinct actions that get executed based on the LLM discussion.

## Quickstart

ðŸ‘‰ Follow the Action Server [Quickstart guide](https://github.com/robocorp/robocorp?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-quickstart) in the main repository.


## Dependency management

We recommend placing your dependencies in [conda.yaml](conda.yaml).

ðŸ‘‰ More on [managing your dependencies](https://github.com/robocorp/robocorp?tab=readme-ov-file#what-makes-a-python-function-an-%EF%B8%8Faction) in the main repository.


## Actions in VS Code 

ðŸ‘‰ Using [Robocorp Code extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=robocorp.robocorp-code), you can get everything set up and running in VS Code in no time.

The template has a few files that enable the extension to find and set up your action environment and provide code completion. There is also a side panel where we have and will add some easy-to-use functionalities.

When debugging your Actions Python code, you probably do not want to give the inputs every time you run and always be running the Action Server, so you can set your test inputs in a [input.json](./devdata/input.json) and just run/debug your Python code.


## What does the template Action do?

The template is a simple starting point to show how to get started.

The action enables you to get the timezone differences between locations.

We use [pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/) as an example to show that you can leverage the whole Python ecosystem. Robocorp provides a [bunch of libraries](https://pypi.org/search/?q=robocorp-); you can make your own. The sky is the limit.

ðŸš€ Now, go get'em
